# Extend - AI-Powered Generative Housing Project

## Overview

**Extend** is an AI-powered generative housing project designed to tackle the growing global demand for safe, affordable, and sustainable housing. As the world population increases, the challenge of providing adequate housing becomes more pressing. According to the United Nations, by 2030, an estimated 3 billion people will require adequate housing, creating the need for around 96,000 new housing units daily.

Extend addresses this challenge by generating innovative housing designs that focus on:

- **Affordability**: Making housing accessible to all communities.
- **Sustainability**: Incorporating eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient systems.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that designs cater to a diverse range of environmental and societal needs.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to leverage the power of AI to create sustainable housing designs that are affordable and environmentally friendly. Through the use of advanced artificial intelligence, Extend generates designs that:

- Maximize natural airflow and integrate urban vegetation.
- Optimize space for efficient use of materials and energy.
- Analyze site-specific data, considering factors like local weather patterns and sustainability goals.

By enabling communities to build homes that are both sustainable and resilient, Extend seeks to promote long-term environmental resilience and improve the quality of life for individuals and communities.
